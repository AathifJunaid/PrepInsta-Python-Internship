Generating a Random Number**: The game will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100, which you will have to guess.\n","\n","**2. User Interaction**: You will be asked to enter your name, making the game more personalized. Then, you can ask for level of difficulty like easy or hard where we will assign easy 10 guesses and hard level only 5 guesses.\n","\n","**3. Feedback Loop**: After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too low or too high. This will guide you in making your subsequent guesses.\n","\n","**4. Limited Attempts**: You will have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number for hard level and 10 for easy level based on level you choosen. Can you solve the mystery within these attempts?\n","\n","**5. Victory or Defeat**: If you successfully guess the number within the given attempts, you will be celebrated for your guessing prowess. If not, the game will reveal the correct number."],"metadata":{"id":"Nm2sk7lef8qb"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Oyl_s2Eiel8d"},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\n","Hello, What's your name?\n","Mohan\n","\n","Hi, Mohan I am Guessing a number between 1 and 100:\n","\n","Choose the difficulty Level, Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy\n","You have 10 attempts to guess the number.\n","Make a guess: 2\n","\n","Your guess is too low\n","Guess again.\n","You have 9 attempts to guess the number.\n","Make a guess: 99\n","\n","Your guess is too high\n","Guess again.\n","You have 8 attempts to guess the number.\n","Make a guess: 50\n","\n","You got it!
